Our middle daughter had her 5th birthday party today. She is mad about Diego, so we dressed the living room up as a jungle, and made all manner of animal themed cakes, games, and activities for her and her little friends to do. Overall it went wonderfully - a couple of hours of absolute mayhem.

The only downer of the day was that our kids found themselves learning a lesson about betrayal of trust today, which was a shame. We found two of the little boys who were invited to the party in their bedroom, busy throwing toys across the room and basically vandalizing everything in sight. I barricaded upstairs off afterwards.

After saying goodbye to everybody at the end of the day, we opened our fridge and discovered 14 paper cups filled with Jelly that we completely forgot about. You don't like jelly by any chance do you?
