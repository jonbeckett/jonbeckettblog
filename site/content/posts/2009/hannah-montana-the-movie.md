This afternoon, while playing the part of "Dad", I took our eldest daughter to see "Hannah Montana - The Movie".

So what did I think ? To be honest, I was blown away. It was excellent - and I wasn't expecting that at all.

You might think I liked it because Rascal Flatts and Taylor Swift were in it, and while they were notable "oh my god - that's..." moments, they didn't really add that much to the movie. Without drivelling on like most movie reviews tend to, I'll boil the movie down to a few observations;

The Hannah Montana movie is a wonderful advert for the stunning landscapes in the mid west

Miley Cyrus is a great singer - no matter how the end result is achieved

The songs are great

The story (people are good, capitalism is not so good) is required viewing for kids

My eight year old daughter danced all the way home. Like she was on steroids. She went to bed grinning.

p.s. I liked it too - but then I like any escapist / uplifting / sentimental movies.
