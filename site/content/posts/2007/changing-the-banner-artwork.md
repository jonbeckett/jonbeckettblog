I felt the banner artwork of Mario was getting a little old, so had a scout around on the internet for something new - something different.

I came up with an image from Final Fantasy - a game we have been playing on the PS2 for a little while now. If you're reading this via a feed reader, I'm guessing you need to click on the link through to the actual webpage to see it (or click here).

Any comments would be appreciated - positive or negative. I never know what to stick at the top of the blog, so any and all feedback or suggestions are good.
