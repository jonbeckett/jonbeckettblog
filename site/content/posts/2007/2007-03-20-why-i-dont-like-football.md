Football is a sport played by under educated, over paid psychophants. When not trying to cheat each other, they run to the referee of a match as small children might to a teacher in a playground, trying to get each other disciplined.

Football is watched by large numbers of people who goad each other with foul mouthed, often racist chants. It is followed by huge numbers of people who claim their support for a team they have never been to watch.

I once visited Oxford on the train, and had the misfortune to share the train platform with a number of people "supporting" a visiting team. The songs (and I hesitate to call them "songs") shouted by them throughout the journey bore most resemblance to those shouted by the Jacobites at Culloden.

When they reached the train platform, a small boy and his father supporting the opposing team were "discovered" by the mob, who surrounded them and screamed "SCUM! SCUM! SCUM!" at them. The father desperately tried to shield his distraught young son from it, and I decided I would never follow football ever again.
