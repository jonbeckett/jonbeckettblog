George - our cat that was hit by a car last week - returned from hospital last night, and is getting used to his home for the next few weeks - a cage in the lounge. He has a view across the back garden, which will hopefully encourage him to sit up, stand up, and exercise his legs over the coming days.

He had a broken pelvis, and several breaks to his left femur. They screwed the pelvis back together, and have re-shaped the top of the femur (apparently cats are very good at adapting to having bits of bone missing - especially in ball joints).

He looks pretty impressive at the moment - with a line of staples on both hips, and lots of fur shaved off. He's licking the wounds, but not trying to pull the staples out (yet). Hopefully he'll leave it all alone long enough to begin healing properly.

Apparently all the nurses at the animal hospital fell in love with him, and couldn't quite believe it when we told them he has two identical brothers...
