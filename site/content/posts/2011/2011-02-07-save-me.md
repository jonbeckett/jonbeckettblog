from this interminably boring coding. I'm tired, I don't want to be doing this, it's boring, and I'm fed up. Woe is me. Boo hoo, and all that.

I need far flung internet friend people to distract me on purpose, in as anarchic/candid/inappropriate (delete as applicable) manner as possible.

Help me obiwan-ki-internet-people - you're my only hope.
