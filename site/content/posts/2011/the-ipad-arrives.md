Finally picked up the iPad on Saturday morning. I've only had a couple of hours to play with it so far, but so far, so good. Everything seems to work.iOS hasn't changed a lot since I had the iPhone 3Galthough there are undoubtedly a lot of features hidden away in the interface that I've not found yet.

Enjoy the photos!
