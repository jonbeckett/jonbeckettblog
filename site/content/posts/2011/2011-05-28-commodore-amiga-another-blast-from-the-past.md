While searching for things in the attic the other evening, I stumbled across a Commodore Amiga computer from the late 1980s that's been quietly sitting in a storage box for a number of years.

After five minutes of playing "Swiv", "Silkworm", and "Stunt Car Racer", our seven year old computer officionado lost interest and went back to her latest craft project (she's doing French knitting at the moment).
