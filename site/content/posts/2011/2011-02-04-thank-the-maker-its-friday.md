Do you ever have days where you can't really concentrate on anything? Where everything seems just a bit too much like hard work to make any progress - or even to begin making progress?

I've had an entire week like that.

Perhaps I should draw up a list of "me" things I want to do this weekend;

Go for a run with the new running shoes, and discover how much fitness I have left.

Take the camera out and about - shoot some photos around town (I used to do this regularly, but haven't in AGES)

Sit down and read a book - harder than it sounds in our house, where three little people continually make attempts on your laughably "free" time.

I bet I'll still end up in the playpark with the kids, watching them rollerskate and skateboard themselves into the ground.
