how a certain six year old girl managed to soak the ceiling above the shower so thoroughly?Even taking into account the technique required (I'm guessing cupping her hands, and throwing the water straight up), given the height of a six year old, and the height of the ceiling, I can't help but be impressed.

While saying goodnight a few moments ago I quizzed her about it (while trying desperately not to smile), and she blamed her sisterwho had a bath, not a shower
