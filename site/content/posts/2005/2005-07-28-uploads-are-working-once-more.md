I have managed to get file uploads up and running in my blog script once more (for those of you who do not know, my main blog at http://www.pluggedout.com/blog is based on a script I wrote, and released as open source). It basically means version 2 is pretty much there now. It just needs spit and polish.

I'll write again later when I've had a beer.
