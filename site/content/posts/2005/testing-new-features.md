The next feature that will find it's way into the Blog script is smilies.

Here's an example;

Ã Ã Ã Ã °Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã  should be a smile

Ã Ã Ã Ã °Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã  should be a big grin

Ã Ã Ã Ã °Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã  should be unhappy

These are only early tests, but it should work okay.
