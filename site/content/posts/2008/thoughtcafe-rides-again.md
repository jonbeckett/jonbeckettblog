It's back. Granted, it's not complete (a long way from it actually), but ThoughtCafe exists on the interwebs once more...

I worked on it late last night, and added a few more bits and pieces at lunchtime. The list of contributors (read:columnists) is growing each day, so hopefully we should have a busy, thriving site in no time at all!

Head on over to www.thoughtcafe.net and check it out!
