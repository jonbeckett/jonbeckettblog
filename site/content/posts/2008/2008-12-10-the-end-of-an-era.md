I confirmed this morning with my boss in London that I will definitely be finishing next Friday.

It's a weird feeling - knowing that something you have known for so long is coming to an end. Although I have continually grumbled about the commuting, the time away from home, and the idiocy of the unwashed masses on the London Underground, I have also made friends here that I will miss.

I guess the challenge becomes one of keeping in touch with each other - not just in the coming weeks, but in the longer term. I wonder if the nascent social networks such as LinkedIn are the answer?
