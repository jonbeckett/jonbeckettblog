I'm looking forward to probably 4 hours sleep tonight.

Discovered at 11pm that I had no clean clothes for work tomorrow. Am sitting here now, with the washing machine on - I will transfer clothes to the dryer when it finishes, and then go to bed with the dryer left on. I will then get up at 5am and start ironing ready to jump on the train to London, where I will no doubt fall asleep in an embarassing manner.

F*cking fantastic.
