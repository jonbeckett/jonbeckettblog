I woke this morning at 7am, and figured I had at least another three quarters of an hour before getting up. To be honest, I was surprised the kids didn't wake up at stupid oclock, given that they all knew it was our youngest's birthday. They finally woke at 7:45, and immediately led the charge into our room.

Happy Birthday's were shouted, eyes were rubbed, robes were pulled on, and we wandered downstairs together to watch the newly titled "Little Miss Seven" open her presents.

How on earth did she get so big? The little monkey who used to suck her fingers when unsure, and daydream all day has turned into a string bean with battlements for teeth, and a superlative sense of righteous justice. She is all elbows, knees, and fast twitch muscle at the moment. She runs like the wind, and is armed with a giggle that undoes even the most stern grown up.
