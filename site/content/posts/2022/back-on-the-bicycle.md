Another week begins - a day late because of a bank holiday - and I find myself in the familiar routine of sipping coffee, attending teams meetings, catching up on email, looking at the calendar for the month ahead, and starting a new month page in the bullet journal.

I'm just sipping coffee, and emptying my head for a few minutes before getting on with something sensible.

I wobbled last month. I tried converting over to Microsoft ToDo and Microsoft OneNote to keep track of daily work tasks. I failed miserably - or rather, they failed admirably. I need to stop tinkering and just admit that I'm a paper and pen kind of person when it comes to taking notes. "Writing up" notes is a very different thing - they can go in the computer somewhere, but while sitting in a meeting, or while trying to figure out what I'm doing today or tomorrow? Paper and a pen.

Of course the whole "writing up" thing is another rabbit hole. I'm good at finding rabbit holes. Do I use Google Docs, Evernote, Notion, or some other platform?  While I play with other systems from time to time, I've kind of settled on OneNote for anything to do with work (so it lives within the walls of work), and Google Docs or Google Keep at home. Being honest, Google Docs is more of a dustbin than anything - I throw things in there, and hope the magical search will be able to find them in the future.

I'm trying to be a little more involved in at least a few social things on the internet. I'm not doing very well so far. An hour of mad following, reading and liking tends to be followed by sudden disappearances as I become distracted by anything and everything nearby. I wonder if there's a place in the Guinness Book of Records for the "most distracted person"?

Anyway. Work calls. Or maybe something to eat first. Where on earth has the morning gone?
