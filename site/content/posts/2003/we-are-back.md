Just a quick note to let everybody who reads this know that we are back from the states. We arrived at Heathrow this morning, got home lunchtime, slept a bit, and now we are both trying to stay awake until fairly late to get our body clocks back onto UK time.

San Francisco was fantastic (although very hectic and we didn't get to do half the things we planned to - which is always the way) and was incredibly hot - well, it was for mad english people who are used to the cold and rain.

Anyway - I'll write more tomorrow when I'm a bit more awake Ã Ã Ã Ã °Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã 
