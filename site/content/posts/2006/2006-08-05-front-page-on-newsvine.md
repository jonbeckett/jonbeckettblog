I don't believe it. I wrote a story on Newsvine and it hit the front page...

I'm something of a fan of Newsvine. Of the little spare time I have at the moment, I typically spend it between Digg, Newsvine, and Rojo.

It's just a very, very good news website. There is a slight US bias, but otherwise it strikes a nice balance between delivering news stories written by journalists, and stories written by visitors to the site - such as myself.

I still can't believe I made the front page - even if it was only for a few minutes...
