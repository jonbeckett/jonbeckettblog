We're off to take part in the weekly pub quiz at the Marlow Donkey later. I will write a more complete blog post upon my return - which will almost certainly communicate all the reasons why we should have won but didn't.

I anticipate that complaints will be levelled at other teams cheating more than us, and therefore doing better than us.
