It's been a long evening;

Installed the prototype of a WordPress blog for a professional client

Installed the development environment for a Drupal site

Installed a sandbox copy of Drupal to teach somebody (in safety)

Re-joined Basecamp to keep track of freelance work

Billed for all manner of coming work

Now time to sleep
