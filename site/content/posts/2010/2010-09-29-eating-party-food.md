We're sat here on the couch eating the leftover party food from our eldest daughter's 10th birthday party. She had friends back from school today for dinner - I walked in from work and was greeted with a lounge emblazoned with multi-coloured balloons, and all manner of party food.

Small sandwiches, sausages on sticks, cheese and pineapple on sticks, crisps, homus, chopped cucumber, carrots, pitta bread, and all manner of other stuff. I'm guessing we are the last bastion of traditional kids parties in our house. There's something about fizzy drinks, small sandwiches, and plastic table cloths that takes me back to being 10 years old too.

Perhaps re-visiting the experiences of our childhood on our own children is no bad thing sometimes.
