I have decided it's high time I left the front door of my blog and went off in search of new and interesting people to read the exploits of, and to become lifelong friends with. That's not too lofty a goal is it?

Quite how one might go about finding interesting, original people on the internet these days without wading through countless amateur poets, makeup bloggers, wannabe fashion bloggers, and such like is something of a mystery at the moment.

Perhaps just posting this will be enough, and will entice a stready stream to my door, eager to find out about the doubtlessly wonderful person that poked his head above the battlements to make the post in the first place.

I suspect it might require a lot more effort.
