Step away from the keyboard. Just step away from the keyboard. For a few minutes. Those are the words I find myself repeating - to myself. Take a break. Walk away. Breath.

It's so easy to just stay here - to keep typing - to keep putting one foot in front of the other. There's so much still to do - the climb stretches out ahead, and probably always will. I find myself wondering when I'll turn from the path - when I'll start making my own decisions.

I struggled this week - with loss, with self doubt. Today I'm struggling to juggle the many things I typically keep aloft. I'm not sure why.

Perhaps I just need the weekend. A few days to switch off, shut myself away, and recharge. A few days to remember who I am, where I'm going, and how I'm going to get there.
