It has just been reported on the news that Michael Jackson died earlier today. Twitter beat the news networks to the news by about a minute.

Although I can clearly remember the Princess of Wales death, this is the first one perhaps in my lifetime that I'm going to mark the time and place in my memory. The first global star to burn out during my lifetime.

There have only been a few of them since "celebrity" was invented along with the cinema and modern journalism. Valentino, Marilyn, JFK, James Dean, and now Michael...

Rest in peace Michael - perhaps now people will start talking about your colossal talent instead of the various hangers on, leeches and money grabbers that blighted the final years of your life.
