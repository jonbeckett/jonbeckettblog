Since I started over with the blog, I've been posting into Posterous, and automatically cross-posting out to Tumblr, Blogger and WordPress. I'm wondering if it's worth bothering with. Some thoughts; It's great that I can post comments on other people's blogs, and use the native logon for that system (e.g. blogger comment leads back to the blogger version of the blog). It's difficult to know which blog I should promote on third party systems I typically fill in the URL for wordpress. It's difficult for others to know which they should follow. I post more stuff to Tumblr (because it's a social network more than a blog) than I do to Posterous. That's one positive, versus several negatives. What to do, what to do
