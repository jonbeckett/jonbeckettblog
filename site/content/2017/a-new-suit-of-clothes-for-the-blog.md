I finally changed the look and feel of the blog this afternoon. I've used this design in the past, and it's always been a favourite. The design (called "Ascetica")focuses on content, but also allows me to surface a few bits and pieces in the margins. I've always thought the trend towards responsive website designsresults in overly minimalist blogs. Maybe I'm wrong.

After a few days I realised I liked the old theme much more. Nothing to see here. Please move along...
