While monkeying with WordPress on Saturday, it appears that I inadvertantly spammed everybody following me to death. Something in the order of 175 notifications of new posts.

Sorry!(as if by magic, I just re-appeared the draft posts once more, but this time I did it hopefully without annoying anybody)
