For the last week or so I have been playing with LiveJournalperhaps the "last man standing" of the old blogging platforms. It was there at the start, and it will probably be there at the endand while it was persuasive for several reasons, it didn't turn out to be persuasive enough to make me stick around.

I'm not going to get into the reasons for my return, because nobody really wants to read negative comments about anything. I will however heap praise on the WordPress development community for their continual headlong rush towards all that is good about the web, mobile applications, standards, protocols, and transparency.

Using LiveJournal for a few days opened my eyes to the scale of the achievement at WordPressit was that simple.
