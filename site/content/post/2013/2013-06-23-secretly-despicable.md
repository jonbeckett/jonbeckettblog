This afternoon we have secret tickets for a family outing to the cinema to see Despicable Me 2. The children have no idea at allin an outrageous exploitation of the fact that they pretty much believe anything we tell them, we told them the movie doesn't open until next weekend (har har).

I wonder how long we can keep the ruse going for?
