I'm working on it. Honest. Stupid really, isn't it - I can write code that would floor most people, I can design websites, create WordPress themes from scratch, deploy Drupal installations, transmogrify Joomla, and yet I can't think of anything to have as a banner for this damn blog.

Give me some time. Or ideas. Yes. Comment with some ideas.

Postscript... the banner is done. Random image of bicycles, "borrowed" from the internet, modified in Photoscape, and then plastered with big words in Xara... it will do.
