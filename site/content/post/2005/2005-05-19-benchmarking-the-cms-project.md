I spent some time this afternoon benchmarking the "Content Management System" project I have been working on. For those who have no idea what that is, a "content management system" is basically a website that is made out of text that you have stored in a database.

The whole idea behind CMS systems (work the acronym out yourself - I'm not typing it again) is that you don't have to fiddle with lots of pages in a website if you are changing something that appears in lots of places - you just edit the bit you need to, and voilatook just over 0.0004 seconds on average. That's the fastest thing I have ever seen - especially taking into account what it is doing Ã Ã Ã Ã °Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã 

So there's the proof if it was needed - my CMS can feed over 2000 pages a second on a single processor server, without any special hardware. That kind of response time is going to cause problems with network connectivity a long time before it starts to slow down.

I have to admit I'm fairly pleased.
