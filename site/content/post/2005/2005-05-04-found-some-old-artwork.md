I just found some old artwork on an ancient Yahoo account of mine that I had forgotten about.

"Depressed"

Highly exotic materials used for this one - felt tip and water (because it's all I had). The pic was of a chess player in an old magazine cutting called "Wolfgang Unzicker". I just like the desperation - I guess anybody who has played chess will identify with it.

"Jodie"

Plain old pencil. The picture is of a girl I worked with for a while, and nearly went out with (thank god I didn't - isn't hindsight a wonderfuly thing). Anyway... there it is.
