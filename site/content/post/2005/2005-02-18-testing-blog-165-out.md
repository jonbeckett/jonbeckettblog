I'm trying out the latest version of Blog - and making it jump through hoops to work correctly with legacy data from the old version...

So far I seem to be winning the battle. If you're wondering what the fuss is about, look at the screenshot below...

For a better look, click on the thumbnail - Blog has rich editing controls at last Ã Ã Ã Ã °Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã  Its taken some doing, but it seems to be working fine.
