Okay - before I start, I would like to state that this will be the last post in the near future where I attack people with strong religious beliefs. I'm not an athiest, but people with closed minds (most people with any level of faith) make me mad.

There are times when words and arguments fail you when trying to open people's eyes - and today I was reminded of a fantastic page on the internet that should remind all god botherers of the idiocy of their blind faith.

I don't need to really say anything, except urge you to click on the link below and read. If you have enough intelligence you will understand the point I am making.
