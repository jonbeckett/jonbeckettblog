I just read a headline in the news after getting into work that made me just a bit angry...

Indonesian Court Finds Australian Guilty

It's basically the story of a woman who went to Bali surfing, and got caught at the airport with marijuana in her surfboard bag. She has been put in prison for 20 years...

If ever there was a reason to boycott a place, that has to be it. This is the same place that my ex-boss sent a honeymoon email from that had a brang new virus in it (that took me the best part of a day to remove from the entire network).
