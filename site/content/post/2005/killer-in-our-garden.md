I think I just caused the death of a small bird in the back garden... the picture above shows the last thing the little bird saw too.

I was in the garden waiting for hedgehogs to appear and our cat appeared silently out of nowhere - so I snapped a picture of him (if my eyes hadn't adjusted to the darkness I would never have seen him either). Unfortunately the camera flash disturbed the birds in one of the trees, and one of them fell through the branches in the dark - the cat of course raced into the thicket at the foot of the tree to await provenance...

I wonder if he realises he'll get no breakfast tomorrow?
