While scratching around for some music to put on for the girls to dance to earlier, I had a brainwave. They had never seen Kylie Minogue before. They have now. The cheer of the audience at the start of the concert caused very excitable squeals and clapping from our youngest - followed by a good hour of frenetic dancing around the room to each of Kylie's records.

It just so happened that W was out shopping during all of this - and when she returned I asked the girls "who have we been dancing to!", greeted by excited shouts of "Kylie!".

W was not best pleased. Not only do we have bright pink bedrooms, flowers on everything and princess dolls everywhere, we now have little Kylie Minogue fans.
