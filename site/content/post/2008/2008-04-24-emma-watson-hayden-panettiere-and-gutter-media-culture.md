Now and again, something happens in the media that makes me angry, and I can't keep my mouth shut about it. This is one of those times.

The minute Emma Watson - "Hermione Granger" of Harry Potter movie fame - turned 18 (a couple of nights ago), the press photographers hounded her every move - and succeeded within hours of pointing a camera up her skirt.

The exact same thing happened with Hayden Panettiere - "Claire Bennet" in the Heroes television series - she turned 18 and an immediate quest began among the Los Angeles paparazzi to point a camera up her skirt.

Is this not sexual harassment? Does the "celebrity" label really mean that these actresses have no right to at least keep what colour underwear they are wearing to themselves?
