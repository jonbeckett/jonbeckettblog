We survived. We have now met our children, who called us "Mummy and Daddy" straight off the bat. Very, very weird - but not the biggy.

The strangest thing, and all I have the mental capacity to write about this evening (and this happened several times) - were little voices shouting "Daddy" from somewhere, and suddenly realising that was me.

It's going to take a while to get used to that.

It all went fantastically. We are exhausted. We opened a bottle of wine the minute we walked in the door. More news as the days progress - tomorrow is nursery, and then having dinner together.
