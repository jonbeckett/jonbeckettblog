If ever there was proof that American society has taken capitalism too far, and should maybe take a long, hard look at itself, then the death of the guy working in Walmart who was trampled by a stampede of customers on Friday really should signal something at least.

I'm sat here shaking my head.

Sure, you might have bought your kids that Nintendo Wii on sale, but you managed to KILL SOMEBODY doing it.

Never mind - you saved a few bucks. You go pat your yourself on the back. Have a happy Christmas.

Being "from the rest of the world" this also touches on the endless stories we are now seeing across the internet of Americans bleeting on about their financial situation. Grow up. The rest of the world has had to deal with boom and bust for generations. Your own damn parents had to in the 1970s. It's about time you started thinking about the colossal damage your country (and most of the developed nations, to be honest) do to the world, and the erosion of values, lack of respect for each other, and selfishness that seems to pervade anything and everything.

Sorry for such a bleak post, but the Walmart story has shocked me.
