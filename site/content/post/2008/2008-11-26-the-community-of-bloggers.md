A couple of years ago I built a forum - mainly because people asked me to - for people who write blogs to create their own community. It never had it's own domain name, or a real "identity" as such, and so eventually fell by the wayside.

I'm wondering about re-creating it, and inviting the world and it's blogging dog to take part.

What do you think?

Would you like to take part in a community of bloggers? Be able to swap ideas, tips, ask questions, share experiences?
