Yes, I have changed the look and feel of this blog yet again, and yes, I am expecting some people to say "ooh, I like this", and others to say "I was just a little bit sick in my mouth".

While wondering if I will continue writing a personal blog on the interwebs, I also wonder if one theme is better than another. This one seems easy to read - but then so do many of the others.

Perhaps the look and feel of a blog is unimportant? Perhaps I should stop fiddling with it? Perhaps I should go and make another cup of tea...
