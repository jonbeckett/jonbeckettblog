I left my mobile phone at work. I feel like I'm cut off from the world... it's very, very weird indeed.

In other news, we were invited to visit friends this evening with no notice what so ever, and thought "what the hell". We have 9 days of being "just us" left, and should perhaps be taking advantage of that. Our friends seem to have also realised this, and the week ahead has filled over the last few days with invitations for take-aways and dinners.

9 days until our life turns upside down, and changes forever.

p.s. found mobile phone this morning by the washing line in the back garden...
