I just ordered an ASUS EEE 1000H - a "netbook". For those interested in what it is / what it can do, here's the low-down;

1.6Ghz ATOM processor

1Gb RAM

80Gb Hard Drive

1.33Kg Weight

10Ã Ã Ã Ã ¢Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã ³ screen (1024Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã 600)

Ethernet, Bluetooth, WiFi built in

Windows XP SP3 pre-installed

It's affordable, it's sensible (the keyboard is much bigger than the 701 EEE PC), and it lasts over twice as long on battery power (mostly due to the ATOM processor).

I compared it with the Dell Inspiron Mini 9, and it seems better in just about every department for the same price. It would seem that ASUS still lead the netbook category pretty convincingly.

As soon as it arrives I will naturally release unboxing photos and experiences of first few hours use. The idea of using as a portable digital photography workstation just occurred to me too...
