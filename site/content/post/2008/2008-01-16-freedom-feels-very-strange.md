It feels very strange, having a personal blog again. While it's liberating to think "I can write about whatever I like", it also causes the question "what the hell am I going to write about?".

In the manner of a tombola, if you suggest a subject as your comment, I will pick one and write about it / answer it. If there are enough suggestions that are legal to answer in a public forum, I will of course answer several.
