Could this be a still from the forthcoming "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince" movie ?

I think it could. I see Hermione is going to be promoting knitted scarfs and hats once again - and check out the Charlie's Angels hair (which is going to cause groans from mothers across the world who will be fishing rollers and hair dryers out for their daughters).
