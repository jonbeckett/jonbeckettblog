We got up this morning and found feathers all over the chicken run, and no sign of W's chickens. Serves us right for not closing the door to the chicken run. I guess that's going to be something else for me to add to the million and one things I do each day (when we get some more chickens).

At the moment my entire life seems to revolve around serving others, catching the ball for others, and taking the blame for everything. I've been up since 7 doing the morning routine, and I'm guessing I'll get lumbered with the job of cleaning up the destruction in the back garden now.

I wonder where we can get some more chickens from?
