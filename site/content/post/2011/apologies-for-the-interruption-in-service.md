If you head to the public facing side of my tumblog, there's all manner of domain jiggery pokery going on today (out of my hands) while the URL blog.jonbeckett.compropogates it's way around the world. Until it happens, you're going to see weirdness.

I'm guessing I'll have to go monkey with Google Analytics, Feedburner, and Disqus too bugger!

Normal service will be resumed soon (hopefully).
