I pulled the trigger on the WordPress blog. While it was a good idea in theoryto seperate the long meandering journal style posts from the brain fart tumblarage (excellent new word), I just don't have enough time, energy, or willing to do it any more.

This is it.

This is my personal blog.

Like it or lump it.
