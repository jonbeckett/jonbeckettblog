You will rarely find reblogs in my Tumblogthis is entirely by design. I am here to share my life, mythoughts, myexperiences, myideasthat which interests me.I'mnot here to recycle.

I typically only follow those who do the same (with a few exceptions, before anybody gets on my case about it). I like to read about people's daysee their photoshear their thoughts about things.

I've always been something of an individualnever quite fitting in. I guess I seek that out in others toothe square pegs.
