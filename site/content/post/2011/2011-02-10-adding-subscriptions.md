I added a load of subscription goodness to the blog today via the lovely folks at Feedburner (umm I guess that would be Google then). If you have no idea about this, FeedBurner integrates with Tumblr, and keeps track of who is following you via the RSS feed - data you would otherwise know nothing about.

One of the nice benefits of Feedburner is people can also email subscribe - so they get your new posts emailed to them.

Go check out the Subscribe page!

It's all good!
