The anonymous question I received this morning from a far flung admirer got me thinking about friendship in general, and how the modern world seems to have done everything it can to dissuade us from friendship.

Perhaps some of the reasoning for these thoughts surfacing is Barack Obama's speech at Tucson yesterday;

In the fleeting time we have on this earth, what matters is not wealth, or status, or power, or famebut rather, how well we have loved, and what small part we have played in bettering the lives of others

Perhaps it's time to stand up. Time to tell those we love. Time to reach out to friends, to be there, and to remember the difference we can make to each other.

Do it. I dare you. (feel free to reblog this too - we need to spread this message far and wide - let's start something)
