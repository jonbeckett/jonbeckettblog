After a long day out, I suggested we take the children to Nando's for dinner. The look on W's face was a picture.

We rarely go out for dinner, because we can't afford to, but it basically means; No cookingNo washing upNo struggling to get any of the kids to eat thingsNo hunting for something to cookNo cleaning the kitchen up after Yeah, we've blown another hole in the bank account, but everybody is happy this evening.
