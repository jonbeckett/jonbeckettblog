Wouldn't it be great if there was an open directory, where anybody could post Tumblogs, or posts they like, as often as they like? Kind of like an open directory

A place you could go to find interesting people to follow, by searching what others have to say about them, or by how many other people like the link to them in the directory (think Digg)

If there's enough interest, I'll build it.
