While monkeying with Tumblr recently, I have somehow ended up making three different themes

Professional The original one, with nice shaded borders, social icons, and understated design. It's not getting into the Tumblr directory because of the social icons (as far as I can guess).

Personal The simplified theme I'm using for "jonbeckett" (my own tumblog).

Glamour A hack of "Professional" that I did for "Accessory Whore" - the plain vanilla version is pretty simple to hack around.

If you want to have a play with them, just copy the source into your "Customize Theme" panel, and take a look. It's worth pointing out that I keep updating them as I find problems with them - I should really have some kind of proper page for them at some point, to flag up new versions, etc.

Anyway enjoy!
