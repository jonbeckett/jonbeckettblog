It's all change in software developerville for the next few weeks. In order to help collaboration with colleagues I'm working closely with over the next few weeks, I've upped sticks, and moved desks.

It's all looking a bit minimalist around here at the moment - nothing on the desk, and nothing on the walls. I'm only going to be here for a few weeks - but I'm already wondering what to steal from my "normal" desk... perhaps the photo of W and the children? The pen tidy? The magazine rack?
