I'm "jonbeckett" everywhere else. I'm also seriously thinking about using Tumblr as my main "personal blog" rather than anywhere else. They really doseem to be turning a corner in terms of reliability, and of course the community is awesome.

It also means I can connect up Twitter, which might encourage me to use it a bit more (although I doubt that).
