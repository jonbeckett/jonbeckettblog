What the hell is happening to the world? This evening David Arquette was involved in a car crash, and the bystanders took photos of him rather than check he was ok. Then they sent the photos to the TMZ website.

TMZ then embellished the story, and posted it as a fictional live blog as Arquette lay "bleeding" at the side of the road.

Following that the story began trending on Twitter, as millions of voyeurs picked over it, and hovered like vultures, hoping for a really big disaster to read about.

How on earth did the world get reduced to this...
