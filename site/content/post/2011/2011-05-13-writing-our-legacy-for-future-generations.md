It's a strange thing, this "internet". I sit here in a darkened room tapping away on a small slab of plastic with a glowing screen, and within seconds of hitting a "submit" button, my words, thoughts, views and ideas will be transmitted throughout the world. Machines will read the words and store them for tomorrow, for next year, and for countless decades into the future. Long after we are gone, future generations will be able to look back on the traces we leave and piece together the parts of our jigsaw; who we were, where we lived, and what we thought about. Our hopes, our dreams, our fears. I like that.
