Still tinkering with jonbeckett.com - at least I have the aggregator working now (after hacking the Drupal 7 database - it didn't like the long titles of Tumblr questions).

I've started putting together pages covering the Tumblr themes I've been working on - allowing feedback, so people can report issues etc.

Personal Theme

Glamour Theme

Professional Theme

Over the next day or so I'll try and get the above pages sorted out properly - with screenshots, demo installations of the themes, and so on.

Perhaps one of the more clever things Drupal can do is aggregation of content - the following links show aggregated content from just about everything I do online
