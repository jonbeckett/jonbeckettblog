I've just gone through the various iterations of the blog (Posterous, Tumblr, WordPress and Blogger) and fleshed out the Contact and Links pages. I'll link to the tumblr versions for the purposes of illustration if you want to take a look; turningthepedals.tumblr.com/contact turningthepedals.tumblr.com/links The contact page lists the various email and IM addresses you can find me at, and the links page lists the various blogs and social networks I can be found at. Have fun exploring, linking, friending, following, or whatever you want to do
