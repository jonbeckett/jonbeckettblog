I started writing this post half an hour ago, and only just got around to posting it.It's been one of those mornings so farIn the spirit of "life streaming", here's the important information of the moment;It's tipping down with rain outsideI'm hungryI stayed up late last night (what's new there?)My life is just so excitingat the moment it's indescribable. Funnily enough, on Monday the girl that sits behind me commented on my change in mood since returning from a week away - apparently I was happier than I had been in months. That's all gone now. I'm back to Mr Curmudgeon.
