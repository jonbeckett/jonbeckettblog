I had never heard this story before you want to know why Molly Ringwald suddenly vanished at the height of her fame? She insisted that John Huston have the end of "Pretty In Pink" rewritten, so she ended up with the Andrew McCarthy character, instead of "Ducky".

In reaction to this, Huston went on to re-make Pretty in Pink in the guise of "Some Kind of Wonderful" - only he switched the genders. He even offered Ringwald the supporting actress role opposite Eric Stoltz, which she refused because it wasn't the lead.

Huston went on to make a string of wonderful movies, and Ringwald's movie career went straight down the drain.

The big question is - which is your favourite movie - "Pretty in Pink", or "Some Kind of Wonderful"?
