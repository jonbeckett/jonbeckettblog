I am supposed to be back in the office tomorrow - however, unless some kind of miracle occurs overnight, it might be a little short lived. I'm running a HUGE temperature, and my head feels like it's filled with sneeze. Weird description, I know.

We are home by the way - 6 hour journey, an hour unpacking, and a couple of hours checking stuff out online before collapsing into bed.

Roll on the weekend, and a chance to relax once more.
