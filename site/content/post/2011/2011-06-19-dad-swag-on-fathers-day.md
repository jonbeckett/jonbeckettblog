There are probably worse things you could wake up to on a Sunday morning than this little collection - delivered to the bedroom by three little girls wearing mismatched pyjamas, and sporting crazy scientist hair...I'm guessing there will be a requirement to share the chocolates. I wonder if I should admit to the girls I have seen the cake W has baked too? While wandering through the kitchen last night, I happened upon a monster of a chocolate cake - being covered in chocolate icing - and was told "you haven't seen this".
