I just ordered some New Balance running shoes. I'm also going to send in the entry form for our local 5 mile running race - it takes place in May, so it will give me some time to get back into running (I haven't been out running properly for about 3 years).

Next thing to solve - when to run. I used to like running in the morning, but given our schedule with getting up and getting the kids ready for school on a morning, that will mean leaving the house at 6am to get an hour run in.

Hmmm will be interesting to see how much fitness I still have.
