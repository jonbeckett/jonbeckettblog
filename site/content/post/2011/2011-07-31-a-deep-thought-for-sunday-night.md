The most interesting thing about any of us is our differences. If we follow the crowd, and adopt their views and opinions as our own, we may as well cease to exist. Our thoughts and beliefs are importantthey connect us, they differentiate us, they bond, and they separate. They make us the people that our friends confide in, and look for in times of need.
