Astronomy night with the brownies went well. So well in fact that our 7 year old said this on the way home;

"Dad is the best teacher ever"

This was followed by a story coming from my other half about a teacher at the school asking where I taught (this was in relation to me getting our eldest to understand something recently).

Lots of people have remarked over the years about my ability to explain things to people - I'm thinking it's the same reason kids like me; if I play a game with them, I play it on their level. I was the one at christmas making the kids nearly wet themselves while playing with the playpeople you know - the story where the pirates tried to steal a horse, so an elephant sat on them

Anyway teaching. If not for particular kids yapping incessantly, and not knowing where the line was in terms of telling them to SHUT THE F*CK UP!, I probably could be a teacher.
