I just filled out an online survey at Google (you can do the same here). The results kind of speak for themselves, don't they.

Of course now I'm imagining some kind of tron-esque nightmare scenario where the internet becomes sentient, and starts subsuming people into itself. I'm going to be pretty near the front of that queue, aren't I...
