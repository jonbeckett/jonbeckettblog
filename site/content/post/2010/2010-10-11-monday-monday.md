Ba daaa, baa da daa daa...

It's a hummy kind of day, the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and I'm sat in front of a computer wrestling with C# webservices for a SharePoint development project. Guess you can't have everything.

See... this is the problem with music, and me. I pressed play on "Monday Monday" while writing this, and just sat through the last few minutes, bobbing my head, lost to the world. Easily distracted, I guess.
