At the end of dinner last night, while we were all sat at the table, I leaned behind myself an retrieved a box of quiz questions that we acquired at Christmas. The kids all volunteered answers to the avalanche of questions that followed (if only we had buzzers!) - some bone headed, some inspired.

Nothing prepared us for the wisdom of Little Miss 5 though.

Mum : "What stops trees from falling over?"

Little Miss 5 : "Sellotape."
