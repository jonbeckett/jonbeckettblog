For the past few days we have been camping with our children in the Forest of Dean. Following a marathon slog, today we pulled the tent down, packed everything (including the kids) into the car, slogged home, unpacked everything, switched on the washing machine, downloaded the photos, and resumed the mayhem.

I'll write a somewhat more thoughtful post later - in the meantime, enjoy a few of the hundreds (and I do really mean hundreds) of photos I took...
