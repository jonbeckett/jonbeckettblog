I just bought a new theme for my tumblog - "Well Liked" by Peter Vidani.

Not quite sure whyI did it, given that I'm a professional web designer by trade, and could quite easily conjure up something similar by hand, but then I guess it comes down to how much you value your time.

Example - if you are an engineer, do you build your own car, or buy one ready made? Which is the best use of your time? How much do you value your own time?
