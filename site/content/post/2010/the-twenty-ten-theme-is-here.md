I wasn't expecting this until the release of WordPress 3. Today the mighty powers atop mount WordPress released the "Twenty Ten" theme unto the sweaty masses. I like it. A lot. The lack of a good, simple, readable theme was the main reason I was hosting WordPress myself - now that entire reasoning has gone out of the window at a stroke.

When I finish working on the mounds of Javascript and webservices later (yes, I am working overtime AGAIN), I'll write something more.

I'm guessing I need to choose something appropriate for a banner graphic.
