Today's topic of choice is "Event Receivers" in Microsoft SharePoint. Just tripped over "BeforeProperties" (I realise this will all make no sense whatsoever to anybody who has no SharePoint development experience, and I make no apology whatsoever).

Sansa Clip+ is filling my ears with all kinds of crap music today. Should probably do another album refresh.

WHY?

Why can Visual Studio not attach the debugger to the SharePoint process!? I have a feeling the only way of getting it to reliably work might be to sacrifice a penguin in front of it, or something similar.
