Saturday was filled with a visit to relatives we should really visit far more often in Oxfordshire.

The girls finally got the chance to meet their closest cousin, and predictably thought she was the best thing since sliced bread.

On the way home we went through the center of Oxford (by accident), but it also gave the kids the chance to see the city where we met.

Saturday night was the School "Parents and Friends Association" dinner dance.

Much fun was had by all (and much drunk, and much idiotic dancing done)

Sunday morning saw us dragging ourselves down to the local park to run the Sport Relief Mile.

Myself and Wend somehow managed to coax the children around the course.

Very proud of our three little running machines Ã Ã Ã Ã °Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã 
