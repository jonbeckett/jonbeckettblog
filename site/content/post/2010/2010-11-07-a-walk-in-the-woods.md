Given that friends are always telling me that I should post more photos, our trip to the local woods this morning handed just such an opportunity.

Autumn is probably my favourite time of year - the colours, the smells, and the feel of the morning sunshine are fantastic.

Sometimes it's good to remember that a world exists outside the door too - away from the internet, software development, webdesign, programming, blogging, social networks, and all these places we spend so much time in, but don't really exist.
