While showing a colleague the "weebly" website this morning, I spotted their notification telling me that "jonbeckett.com" was available. After a few minutes of indecision, I wandered over to GoDaddy, and registered it. I used a promo code and managed to get 2 years for $15.

Next question - where to point the domain name at ?

Given that I am trying to use the same username everywhere, I thought perhaps I should have some kind of landing page on the internet. A neat and tidy place to point people towards. It will also stop other people buying the domain name in the hopes of extorting money (idiots).

Aha 

I imagine within days I will point it somewhere else, but for the moment it's all good. I don't use Tumblr, but I'm not going to let that stop me.
