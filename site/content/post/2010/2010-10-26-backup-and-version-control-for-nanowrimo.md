If you're going to take part in NaNoWriMo this year, how would you feel if your computer died half way through the competition and took your writing with it?

There's any easy solution - DropBox - an online storage service that appears as a folder on your computer. If you save your writing in the dropbox folder, you get backup and version control for free.

If you're wondering what word processor to use, you could do far worse than one of the following, which are all designed to go full-screen, and prevent distractions while writing;

WriteRoom (Mac)

DarkRoom (Windows)

PyRoom (Linux)

Just save your word in your DropBox folder, and you're done - it's automatically backed up "in the cloud", and version controlled - each time you save, a new version is stored.
