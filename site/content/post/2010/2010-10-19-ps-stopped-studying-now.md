Got fed up of studying. Learned as much as I am likely to learn. Getting ready for early getaway in the morning to reach Reading way ahead of the exam time - then to coffee shop to chill for a bit.

As long as I hit the pass mark, I don't really care (of course, in reality I'll be pissed if I don't get close to 100%)
