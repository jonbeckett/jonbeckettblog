This gives some insight into the depths of my geekiness. I just glanced down at the time, and noticed it was 13:37.

1337 = Leet = Elite

It's hacker-speak, and I really shouldn't have noticed it, but I did. At some point in the last ten or so years, little kids who think they know more than they do developed their own idiotic language, replacing letters with numbers, abbriating common letter combinations, and adding various random Z characters on the end of anything that might fit.

They became known as "script kiddies" because they invariably copied bits and pieces of javascript, PHP, and Perl from each other without really knowing what the scripts did, or how they worked.
