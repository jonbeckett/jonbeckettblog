![Pointless list of programming or markup languages I know better than I](https://source.unsplash.com/s9CC2SKySJM/1600x900)


A quick rundown of the various programming languages and/or markup languages that I can program fairly proficiently in I'm not going to say that I'm particularly good at any of them, because there's always somebody better than you at everything

Basic (various flavours)

Pascal (including Delphi)

Visual Basic 3,4,5 and 6

C (various flavours)

C++ (various flavours)

C# (.

NET 1, 1.1, 2, 3, 3.5 and 4)

VB.

NET (same framework versions as C#)

Java

Javascript

Python (2.6, 3)

PHP (3,4 and 5)

SQL (most common DB dialects)

HTML (3, 4, and 5)

CSS (1, 2 and 3)

VBScript (for my sins)

VBA (under duress)

Bash Shell Script (whenever I am allowed)

DOS Batch Script (too often for my liking)

Baatchi (used by binary load lifters)

I've probably missed stuff off the list. Main theme should perhaps be that I've been in this game for FAR too long, and can scare rooms full of students when they realise the mountain of quicksand that lies ahead of them.
