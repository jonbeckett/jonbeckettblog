It's my other half'sÃ Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã  "official" birthday tomorrow - the party is on Saturday night. I just bought herÃ Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã  "official" birthday present from me - a subscription toÃ Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã  "Bookishly".

Bookishly is one of the many subscription delivery services that have become popular in recent years - this particular subscription will deliver ausedclassic paperback book through the post along with some nice tea each month. We talked about which subscription might be best - this one won through because (a) we'll be helping recycle old books, and (b) second hand books smell wonderful.

Oh, and I ordered the mug too, because they totally saw me coming.
