While off work over the last several days, I've been quietly watching, reading, commenting, and liking posts across the various social platforms on the internet.

For the first few days it was fun - then as time passed the realisation hit me that watching the world happen around you is a poor substitute for taking part in the unfolding uncertainty of it all.

What was it that Dumbledore said?

"It does not do to dwell on dreams, and forget to live".
