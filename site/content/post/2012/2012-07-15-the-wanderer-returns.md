R. Tolkien famously wrote "some things that should not have been forgotten were lost". Such is the story of this blog. It was born in reaction to beginning again at some point in the distant pastan effort that failed, curtailed by the draws of Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. Most recently, the distraction has been caused by Tumblr, and it's seductive Veela-like community

Could the arrival of this post, and the backlog of previous writing be described as platform switch? Perhaps. Maybe it's a reaction to the essentially shallow nature elsewhere. Maybe it's a reaction to the dying of the blogging light. Who knows.

I guess the important thing is that I am here again, and I am writingrecording my days so that future generations might look back and know who I was; what I thought, dreamed, and worried about.
