Arthur C Clarke was the first author I really connected with. His stories captured my heart and mind, and demonstrated the power of the written word. Where Arthur Conan Doyle's "Challenger" stories bordered on fantasy, Clarke's were tantalisingly possible - maybe not today, and maybe not tomorrow, but some day soon.
