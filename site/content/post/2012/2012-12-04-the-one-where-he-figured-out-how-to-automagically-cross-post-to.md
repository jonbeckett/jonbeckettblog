It never occurred to me before that the publishing features of WordPress could automatically publicise my scribbling - I hesitate to call it "writing" - out to Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr. If this works well, be content in the knowledge that I can spam the interwebs with a simple click of the "Publish" button. A whole world of inane navel gazing is readying itself to march on the unwashed masses in much the same way as Saruman's army.

The only problem with automagically cross-posting my words out across the internet is spelling, grammar and punctuation. It's so easy to hit "publish", I invariably do - and then proof read the live article before re-posting it several times.
