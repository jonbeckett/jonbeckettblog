I don't seem to have much to volunteer to the internet at the moment. There are only so many ways you can tell the story "cycled to work, worked, cycled home, did chores".

I did explode at Miss 16 this morning I suppose, and bought her a big bag of peanut M&Ms and a chocolate milkshake on the way home to make peace (it seems to have worked).

Maybe I'll wander back into Second Life later, and pretend to be friends with pretend people in a pretend place for a couple of hours. I'm wondering if it's worth it though. I'm wondering that about a lot of things at the moment.
