It's been a day. And that's all I have to say about that. I'm not going to empty my head, and record a potentially destructive record of everything that went on today. I'll go to bed, get up in the morning, and pretend that tomorrow is another day - you know - like all those crappy inspirational quotes say.

Tomorrow is another day, but yesterday still happened, and tomorrow will likely be very similar - and the days to come. You kind of get used to it, and keep plodding on regardless of the amount of crap you have to deal with. You acclimitise to it all in the end.
