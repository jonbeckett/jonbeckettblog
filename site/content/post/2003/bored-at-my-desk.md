It's the day after "New Years Day", and I'm back at work. I can't say I'm thrilled to be here, but at least the stuff I am working on is going fine.

I've been picking at this BLOG site inbetween doing my real work all morning - stealing things from my previous blog (which will soon be no more), and adding functions here and there. I think the only major thing missing is some shortcut buttons to navigate to current, previous and next blog entries. I'll probably sort that out tonight.

It's quite amusing looking through the blogs on the various diary sites around to see what people are talking about - and the range of personalities. Makes you realise that perhaps your life isn't so boring or bad after all. The amazing thing to me was how many women write online diaries - they must outnumber the men ten to one.

You would never guess that I'm just sat here typing this to avoid carrying on with my work, would you Ã Ã Ã Ã °Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã 

Okay... if I'm going to waste time I might as well do it properly. What's on my desk?

Working from left to right, I have two plastic box file type paperwork holders. They stand upright and have about twice too much paper in each. Why I don't just bung 90% of it in the bin is anybodies guess - but then that would be hard work, wouldn't it.

Next along is the box for "Visual Cafe", and a pile of Java and Javascript books... we always joke about they guys on the front of the technical programmer books - they invariably have tight t-shirts with the O-Reilly drawings on, pot bellies, impressive beards and very thick glasses. It should serve as a warning to us all.

Atop the books stands a logic puzzle and Buzz Lightyear. Buzz protects the office from the evil Zurg empire.

Across the other side of my monitor (which is emblazoned with a couple of tatty sticky notes) is a pen holder with two pens, a ruler, and a photo of my better half wedged in it. There's also an action-man head we dug up out of the garden - I brought it in because it looks like my project manager.

On the far right of the desk we find one of those plastic stacking "in" trays. It looks something like a jumble sale - full of disks, various machinery like a stapler and hole punch, and ten or twenty CD-ROMs - some in their cases, some not.

Isn't my desk excitingLuckily we don't have a "clean desk" rule in our office, so usually mine looks like a hell-hole.

Oh well... that wasted another 10 minutes... better get back to work. I think I can hear my project manager poking around downstairs (he sounds like Darth Vader, and looks like Dracula).
