I can't believe it's September already... It does seem like it should be for some reason. August didn't seem to happen this year - perhaps this is the kind of thing that happens when you get older?

Last week I implemented the blog script on ThoughtCafe. Although there are a few more things to tweak in it, it works pretty well - if you want to see a multi-user variant on the Blog script theme, take a wander over to look at it Ã Ã Ã Ã °Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã 

If you are after a multi-user blogging script then give me a shout and I'll be happy to sell it to you...

Anyway - it's getting late this evening and I feel like making a cup of tea or something. Aha - I just remembered there is some Grolsch in the fridge.
