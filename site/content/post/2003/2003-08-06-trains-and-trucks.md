For the last two days I have been working on-site at Swindon - about an hour and a half journey by train.

I'm pretty happy because the stuff I was working on turned out to be pretty straightforward, and I was able to use a chunk of programming I developed a couple of years ago in a totally new way.

Anyway - this entry is really just to let everybody know that I am still here, and I'll try and find time tomorrow to write a real entry in this blog!
