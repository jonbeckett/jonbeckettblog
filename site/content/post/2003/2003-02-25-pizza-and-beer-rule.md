Today is a good day.

Today I solved problems. I finished tasks. I walked to work in the sunshine. I ate Pizza. I drank beer.

Today is indeed a good day Ã Ã Ã Ã °Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã 

You know, it's only after you've felt like sh*t for a few days that you realise how good it feels to be healthy again. This morning I left the house and walked to work (mainly due to my mountain bike's imploding rear hub tricks the other night) in the sunshine. The sun was shining, the birds were singing. Winnie the Pooh would have said it was a "hummy kind of day".

This evening I'm kicking things around on the internet and basically having a laugh. Indychick's sat in the lounge playing "The Sims" on the laptop. We really are the geek family from sad-city Ã Ã Ã Ã °Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã 

Let's have a count-up. Two desktop machines in here - one configured as a Linux server and networked to the one I'm using. Over on the side is an old(ish) laptop which gets upgraded tomorrow if the bits arrive, and of course Indychick has the shiney new laptop to play the Sims on. Across the hallway lies gaming nirvana - a SNES, a Megadrive (Genesis), a PS2 and a Spectrum Plus lie in wait for mammoth gaming sessions....

I feel good. The world feels good. And ThoughtCafe seems to be running well Ã Ã Ã Ã °Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã 
