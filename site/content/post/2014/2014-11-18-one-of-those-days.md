You know those days where you do everything you know to make something better for somebody, and they keep coming back with problem, after problem, after problem ?

Yeah. That.

I can't say any more, because it's to do with work. It made me think twice about the future again though. About my long term future building things for paying customers. I'm not sure how much fuel I have left in the tank to deal with people.

Rant over.
