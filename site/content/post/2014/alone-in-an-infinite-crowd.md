One of the most difficult things about becoming friends with people on the internet is that you only really know them through the photos and words they shareyou don't really know them at all.

Sometimes they quietly vanish from your life, and you don't realise for weeks or months, and eventually resign yourself to hitting the "unfollow" button, not really knowing if it was anything you did, or said.

The internet makes the world very small, but it can also make it very lonely.
