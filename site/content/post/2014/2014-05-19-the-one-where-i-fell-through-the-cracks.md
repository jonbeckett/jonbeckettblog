For the past several days all I seem to have done is "exist"doing chores around the house in the absence of the rest of the household (save for our eldest daughter). Friday night got in, washed up, cut the lawn, tidied the tip of a house up a bit, made dinner, watched movie with eldest. Saturday took eldest shopping for clothes and shoes for school, and saw Godzilla. Got home, made dinner, washed up, watched movie with eldest. Sunday put 10 loads of washing through the machine, hung out to dry, fetched back in, and folded. Others got home, and mayhem returned to the house while I tried to pack clothes for travel with work this week.

I was absent from the interwebs for pretty much the entire weekend, and as far as the social internet is concerned, if you're not online, you pretty much don't existTumblr being the worst culprit for that.

Nobody messaged me. Nobody emailed me. I fell through the cracks of the internet for an entire weekend.
