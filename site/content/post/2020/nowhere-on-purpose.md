I've been sitting in front of the computer all afternoon, reading, tinkering, playing chess, and falling down internet rabbit holes. While sitting here, there's been an uneasy sense that I should be doing something more constructive with my time. Something worthy.

Maybe there's value in doing nothing sometimes. Switching off.

Perhaps a night of video games might help. I can't remember the last time I played Galaxians, Asteroids, Pacman, Mario, and Sonic.
