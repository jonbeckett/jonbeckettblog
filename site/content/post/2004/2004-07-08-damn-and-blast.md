I was halfway through writing an entry for this damned Blog when I stopped to go and have something to eat. I got back, finished writing, clicked on "submit" and the session had timed out - goodbye all my thoughts for today.

Perhaps it will teach me a lesson about not programming my blog script properly; or maybe that I should use a word processor rather than entering these words straight into the back end of the database...

Sod it. I'm not writing it again. Perhaps later I'll have something on my mind I would like to share. Who knows.

p.s. this blog does have a guestbook you know Ã Ã Ã Ã °Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã 
