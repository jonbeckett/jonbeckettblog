Here are some of the first photos from the new camera - a Fuji Finepix S1000fd. It's an amazingly compact little machine, and seems to be very economical on batteries (at least compared to the S9500). The face detection is truly bizarre - seeing it draw boxes around faces in shot is spooky to say the least.
