A few snaps taken on my iPhone at Deeg's wedding party last night. Ws parents babysat for us, allowing us to escape for a few hours. W has far better pictures on her Blackberry (which, it turns out, takes far better photos than the iPhone).

There's also a rather comical photo of me on Facebook - head to my profile page and look in the feed for it.
