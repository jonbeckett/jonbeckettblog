I began wondering this evening if there was a piece of music that I could tie to writing - to blogging. Was there a piece of music that encapsulated the sharing of the days of our lives, the experiences, and the emotions.

This appeared from the depths of my memory...

Is there a piece of music that you associate with writing?
