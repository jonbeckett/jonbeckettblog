Another morning with the children, and another visit to the playparkaccompanied by excited shouts of "Yay!" when I asked if they would like to go. Unfortunately getting socks on the right way up, and shoes on the right feet is something of a trial when you are too excited to control your limbs in a predictable manner.

Given that it's damn cold outside, our youngest required a change of attire; signalled by her trying to climb the stairs while removing her tights. I don't think I ever laughed so much as she got in a temper with her own lack of balance.
