We're sat here trying to make best use of the remainder of our Sunday evening - well, perhaps "evening" is a little wrong. It's 10:56pm at the time of writing.

We are watching Big Bang Theory. It's so damn funny I've taken something like half an hour to write these few sentences.

Okay. Enforced break from the 17 episodes we are ploughing our way through (not all tonight, honest) in order to at least get something written.

Dammit. We started the DVD again.

Another ten minutes... I cannot get anything done with this programme playing anywhere near me. It's a disaster.

I have found the key that completely undoes my semi-intelligent mind. It's dangerous.
