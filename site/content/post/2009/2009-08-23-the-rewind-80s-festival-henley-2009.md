The photos from the "proper camera" of our day at the Rewind Festival, Henley on Thames, 2009. Among the acts, The Blockheads, Nik Kershaw, Go West, The Christians, Howard Jones, Paul Young, Sister Sledge, ABC, and Gloria Gaynor... amazing day. Feel privileged to have seen them all. <a href='http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jonbeckett/M29XvLBCTqKcDZ91FSAWI71tWYs7gJMLhhqlgvhQVgJLdAQB0q5ScVZlhBD5/DSCF1372.jpg.sca
