I'm trying out "Netvibes" - http://www.netvibes.com - as an alternative to Google Reader. If you've not seen it, it's similar to PageFlakes, and iGoogle - allowing you to add all manner of widgets to a webpage with the idea that you make it your "homepage" in your browser; so for instance when you login you can see your email, the weather, news, blog posts, and so on.
