I got a virtualmacheteout this lunchtime, and set about hacking lumps from my personal blog. I have been looking a the "Thesis" default template recently, and liking certain aspects of it, so have unashamedly aped elements of it's design. The main idea is to have more white space, and rely on typography a little more. The sidebar is still a little too busy, but it will do for the moment.

Head on over to http://www.cheeseandbeans.com [http://www.cheeseandbeans.com/]  and take a look.
