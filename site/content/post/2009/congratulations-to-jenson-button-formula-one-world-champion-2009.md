Just a short message to pass on my congratulations across the internet to Jenson Button, who won the 2009 Formula One Drivers World Championship today in So Paulo, Brazil. Following Hill, another stereotypical "gentleman" wins the title, and does so with manners, grace and talent - a refreshing change from the recent roll-call of champions.
