I just registered this blog at Bloglovin. I'm still undecided if I have placed one foot on a polished slide that heads straight to the depths of blogging hell, or if this will be a wonderfulavenue towards discovery ofawesome people. Maybe it's a bit of both.

If you've never heard of it, Bloglovin is a a feed aggregator - which means it gathers blog posts together in one place so you can follow, read, and discover a little more easily. Because it all happens within the site, youcan then keep track of who is following what, and the site can play games with suggesting new stuff to you. The appealing thing to me is that it's not a walled garden -there are blogs from WordPress, Blogger, Typepad, Ghost, LiveJournal, Medium, and who-knows what else in there.
