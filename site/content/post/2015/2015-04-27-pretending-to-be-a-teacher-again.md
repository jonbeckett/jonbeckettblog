I'm putting on my pretend teacher hat once again over the next few days, in an attempt to educate and inspire a room full of business people in the use of something I've become an unlikely expert at (I'm not going to explain what it is, because you might fall asleep half-way through the first sentence, and do yourself a mischief).

I'm catching the train later this afternoon, and will rumble ponderously off across the country - returning later in the week. I will check-in at a hotel a little way from my final destination, and scout out nearby supermarkets to grab something to eat.

Expect a long, rambling update written from the hotel room bed late this evening. Keep an eye on instagram for idiot photos en-route.
