I cycled to work today, and tried out the camera. It really didn't help that the sky fell on my head for the entire journey, covering the camera in water and blurring everything, but it kind of worked. I'll try it again on the way home (it's not raining now - for the first time in 48 hours), but it will be dark on the way home - I have no idea what the video will come out like.

Maybe if it's sunny tomorrow the video will look much, much better. Fingers crossed.
