Over the weekend I found myself repeatedly turning a thought over in my head. Why do I write a blog? What's the point of it all? I suppose the seed of the thought grew from an evening last week when I wrote in a paper journal for the first time in months. I found myself writing without filters, without expectations, and it felt good - like a weight had been lifted.
