I'm returning to Frankfurt again - during the second week of October. I still need to book a taxi transfer to the airport, but everything else is now in place - the flights, and the hotel. Another week of evenings wandering the streets of a foreign city, and sitting alone in restaurants.

I suppose on the plus side the blog gets filled with somewhat interesting posts when I travel. Posts about the people and places I happen upon from day to day. While at home my life becomes routine - predictable - and I can't imagine anybody really want's to read about that.

I have half an hour of my lunchtime left. Half an hour to catch up on the blogs I follow, to say hello to a few distant friends, and to procrastinate famously. Maybe a cup of coffee first though. Coffee always helps the day along, don't you find ?
