My Uncle posted this photo to Facebook a few days agothe man on the left of the photo is my GrandfatherFredalong with fellow captains of the John Harker shipyard in Knottingley, where he spent most of his career. The photo was taken in 1930, which I think makes him about 22 in the photo. I had never seen this photo before, and now I'm wondering what other photos are hiding in the bottom of shoe-boxes, being held onto by elderly family members around the country.

Isn't in interesting to look back at old photosand see your ancestors when they were youngwith their entire lives ahead of themlives you perhaps knew a little of, but will rapidly only exist as stories, and photos in the bottom of forgotten shoe-boxes.
