One of the most difficult things about becoming friends with people on the internet is that you only really know them through the photos and words they shareyou don't really know them at all.

Sometimes they quietly vanish from your life, and you don't realise for weeks or months, and eventually resign yourself to hitting the "unfollow" button, not really knowing if it was anything you did, or said.

People say the internet has made the world smaller. In a strange way it has also disconnected us from each other.
