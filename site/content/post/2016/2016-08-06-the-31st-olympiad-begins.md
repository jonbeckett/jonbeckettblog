I stayed up last night to watch the opening ceremony of the 31st Olympic games from Rio, Brasil. The ceremony started at midnight, and continued into the early hours. I loved it. I think perhaps my favourite moment of the entire thing was the most simple - when Giselle Bundchen walked across the floor of the Olympic stadium to "The Girl from Ipenima".

Good luck to the many thousands of athletes taking part. Here's hoping that the games will be fair, and that the next generation of children will be inspired to become faster, stronger, and better than they ever dreamed.
