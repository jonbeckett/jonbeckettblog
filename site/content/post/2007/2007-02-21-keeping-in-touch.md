If anybody would like to keep in touch with me during my various adventures in London (where I have no access to instant messaging, and limited access to private email), I would encourage everybody to go look at "Twitter" - www.twitter.com.

I am jonbeckett73 on twitter - feel free to add me as a friend.

Twitter is brilliant - you can text it from your phone, or via their website, and anybody who has marked you as a friend receives the texts you send - and you theirs.

Easy really - and FREE.
