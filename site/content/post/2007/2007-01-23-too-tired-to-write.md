I got up at 6am, travelled to London, and walked back in the door at 7pm. Tomorrow I will leave the house at 6:25am (meaning getting up at 5:30am).

I cannot comprehend how tired I am going to feel tomorrow night based on how tired I feel right now.

Tea. I need a cup of tea. Then prepare clothes for the morning, a map, and get my bag ready for two days sat in a classroom learning about another new technology (a workflow engine, if you were wondering).

Roll on Friday, and some semblence of predictability and normality returning to my world...

(p.s. I still have the new Take That album on my mp3 player, and still love it - in the face of so many people who will snigger at that thought.).
