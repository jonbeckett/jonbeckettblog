While out shopping this morning (buying some goodies to cheer W up), I bought something for myself - Final Fantasy XII...

I'm not quite sure how or why, but I never "got" the Final Fantasy games in the past. For those who are/were equally as clueless as me, they are role playing games, driven by a story, and have something of a reputation as being the best of their genre. Usually when people tell me that something is "the best" I will take no notice at all - but this time I'm wondering what I've been missing out on.

After playing the game for a little over an hour, I can quite confidently say it's the best computer game I have ever played. It's entertaining, interesting, involving, and both looks and sounds wonderful. It's the closest thing I have seen so far to true interactive fiction, and quite worryingly I can see that this game will have double or triple this effect on W...
