On Monday evening my watch stopped. I'm tempted to recite lines from "My Grandfather's Clock" but seeing as I have no plans on dropping dead in the near future, the words don't really fit. I therefore find myself on the several-yearly quest to find a new wrist watch.

While I can see that there is a liberating aspect to not knowing what time it is while having a wash, or walking along the street, I also know that the time is only a glance at my mobile phone away, and it's not like I'm on my way to defuse a bomb or anything. At the same time, I have looked at my empty wrist too many times now. It's not funny any more.

A cursory search on Google finds "The Watch Hut", and I spy the badge for "Omega" - ooOOoooo - the same watch as James Bond (umm... I know he's not real). A glance at their price sends me scurrying back to Casio and Accurist. Ouch! Even Casio don't seem to do a metal watch for anything under 100 pounds. What's gone wrong with the world?

What watch do you have? How much did it cost? Do you like it? These are important questions...
