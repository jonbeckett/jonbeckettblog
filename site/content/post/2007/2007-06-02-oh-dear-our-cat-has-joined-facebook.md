I don't believe it... our cat is on Facebook...

I'm wondering if W has added him, if Simpson has mind-controlled W into doing it, or if Simpson did it himself while we were asleep.

We did notice that following his arrival on Facebook, Simpson was nowhere to be seen. Did this mean he had completed a Lawnmower-man-esque matter transfer into the internet? Is this his final escape (following the knowledge that all cats are of extra-terrestrial origin) from our captivity?

Only time will tell. I bet he ends up with more friends than anybody we know too...
