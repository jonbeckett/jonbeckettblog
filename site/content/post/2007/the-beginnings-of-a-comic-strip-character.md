In a shameless attempt to draw a version of myself as a cartoon character over the last half an hour, I came up with the following...

I'm thinking it will be easier if I draw myself, because I can just look in the mirror for inspiration at faces I might pull. I'm also thinking this comic strip should be a parody on my own life.
