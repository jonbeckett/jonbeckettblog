Many years ago I studied art at college. While digging around in the loft recently, what once was lost became found once more.

If I had listened to my tutors, I would have left college and gone to university to study for a degree in art. As is common with a talent though, I had absolutely no interest in it. Drawing and painting was always something I could "just do", with no effort required.

I've often told people that while I have the capacity to be a far better artist than software developer, I would be bored by it. Of course history has also proven that information technology is where the money is - I would like to claim that as the basis of my decision to pursue a career with computers, but I cannot.

I have drifted through this life so far. While that may infuriate some people, it does tend to make each year more interesting than the last.
