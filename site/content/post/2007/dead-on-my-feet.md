The day started for me at 6am when I got up. I left the house at 7am, and did battle with the rail network for several hours. I then worked like a trojan all day. After several more hours having a rematch with the rail network, I walked back in the door at 9:30pm.

You will perhaps forgive me if I don't spend very long writing a blog, or chatting with friends this evening. I've had enough for today... (where's that big bottle of port?)
