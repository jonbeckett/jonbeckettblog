Today finds me having not written anything in my blog for a week, and wondering what to write. It's been a long time since I have written so few posts, and I have no idea why.

Perhaps it a biorhythm thing. Who knows. All I know for certain is that I could really eat a pizza, some chocolate ice cream, and whatever other crap I can lay my hands on.
