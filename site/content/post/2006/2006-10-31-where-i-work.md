On the way to work this morning I took my camera, and stitched several photos together. Here's the view of the estate (I have no idea if this will work or not - you should get a scrollable box if I get the HTML right...)

The photo is of the Harleyford Estate, on the outskirts of Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, England. Our offices are directly behind where the photo was taken from (I was stood in the doorway).

Feel free to comment!
