Here's an idea. I am inviting you to ask me up to 4 questions each in the comments, and this evening I will answer the first 20 questions.

Think about the questions you ask - make them interesting - the kind of question that other people will want to know the answer to.

I will admit I am now slightly nervous of what questions I will receive. What have I done?
