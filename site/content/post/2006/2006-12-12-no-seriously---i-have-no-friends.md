I have one friend on Twitter. This is embarrassing. Please help me solve this problem...

1) Join Twitter (www.twitter.com)

2) Add me as a friend (jonbeckett73)

You know you want to. (As an aside, why does the help section in the Twitter website not have "what to do if you have no friends" in it?).
