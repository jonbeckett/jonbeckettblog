Wow - what a response... after yesterday's post where I made comments in passing about Will Young and Kelly Clarkson, I was deluged with emails and comments.

Is this where I admit that I have a Will Young album, and also have a couple of compilations with Kelly on? Okay - I admit it - they can sing, I was wrong. I admit it. They don't write their own music, play an instrument, and neither are part of a "proper" band though. Mind you - Madonna doesn't either. Or Kylie.

Here we go...

I, Jonathan Beckett, in front of all those here reading, propose that I shall never cast random aspertions against B-List celebrities without first constructing a coherent argument against them.

p.s. if you look at the photo accompanying this post, the sun could almost be shining right out of Will Young's ass...
