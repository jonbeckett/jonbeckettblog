Today finds me writing a somewhat short post. We have spent all day sat in a classroom confronting our preconceived ideas, thoughts and fears about maintaining contact with an adopted child's birth parents.

It's been draining, thought provoking, and strangely uplifting.

We are both wiped out.

One day - when I have more energy - I will write about this entire journey.
