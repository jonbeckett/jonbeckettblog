I'm sat here wondering how powerful "Word of Mouth" might be when starting a new website.

I've just got "PluggedOut Writers" up and running, but have no money to advertise it's existence - so will have to rely on people telling each other to get it up and running. I hate asking people for help, so hopefully everybody who reads this will take pity on me and do their bit in mentioning the new writing site in their blog.

Anyway - I guess I should get on with some work. I promise to write a "proper" blog entry later.
