After reading The 13th Apostle this morning, I looked at the webcam over on the corner of the desk, and wondered if I could figure out how to record something too. Something vaguely interesting - such as the blogs I read and would recommend to others.

Click on the "play" icon on the movie below, and enjoy.

It's my first go at recording anything on video, and my first go at uploading anything to YouTube. I'm sat here with my fingers crossed that this is going to work at all. If the reaction to this is positive enough, I'll record some more stuff soon.
