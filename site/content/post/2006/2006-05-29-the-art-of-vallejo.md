Following on last night from the post of a piece of artwork by Sorayama, here is a painting by Boris Vallejo.

You have probably seen Boris Vallejo's artwork on countless posters and book covers over the years - he's an amazing artist. Most of his work is fantasy/erotic subjects. I think his style is amazing - the quality of the light, and the solidity of the figures in his paintings is amazing.
