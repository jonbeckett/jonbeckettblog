## What's it all about ?

This is my personal homepage on the internet - where I post various bits and pieces of writing from time to time.

While not bashing my head against the desk repeatedly at work, or sitting in conference calls pretending to be clever, I write idiotic blog posts, occasionally trudge around town in running shoes, and attempt to survive living in a house with four women and two cats.

I lives in deepest darkest England â€“ land of good manners, punctuation, starched shirts, and silent indignation. I grew up near Oxford, and have ended up living in the countryside just outside London.

I like pizza, wine, chocolate biscuits, tea, coffee, movies, music, and cycling. I am as as colour-blind as a hedgehog in a bag, but can draw a mean doodle. I listens to random music on Spotify, watch streaming TV shows on the internet, and spend far too much time playing retro video games.
