## What's it all about ?

You are reading the personal homepage of Jonathan Beckett - where he posts various bits and pieces of writing he has worked on for the last several years.

While not bashing his head against the desk repeatedly at work, or sitting in conference calls pretending to be clever, he writes idiotic blog posts, occasionally trudges around town in running shoes, and attempts to survive living in a house with four women and two cats.

He lives in deepest darkest England â€“ land of good manners, punctuation, starched shirts, and silent indignation. He grew up near Oxford, and has ended up living in the countryside just outside London.

He likes pizza, wine, chocolate biscuits, tea, coffee, movies, music, and cycling. He is as as colour-blind as a hedgehog in a bag, but can draw a mean doodle. He listens to random music on Spotify, watches streaming TV shows on the internet, and spends far too much time playing retro video games.
