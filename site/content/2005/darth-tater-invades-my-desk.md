I got in to work this morning and discovered a Firebox package on my desk - to me, and I had no recollection of buying anything. Following a phonecall home I was informed by W that she had bought me a present one night because I got home and seemed a bit glum... here's what I found in the parcel;

Yes - it's "Darth Tater" - Mr Potato Head has turned to the dark side... he now has pride of place on my desk at work, to strike fear into my colleagues. Suggestions have been made that the real plan was that I would be too embarassed to keep it on my desk so would take it home and give it to W - she obviously didn't believe the power of the angry eyes...

I'm wondering now if Darth and Buzz Lightyear are going to have some kind of titanic scrap around the office during the night (everybody knows that toys come to life at night). Duh!

Anyway - I suppose I better get on with some work.
