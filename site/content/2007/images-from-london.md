With one day left on my contract in London, I have started taking photographs of colleagues and places - and writing a lot in my notebook.

Hopefully it will be something to look back on in years to come. I have no idea if I will be back in the city soon, or ever again.

You can click on any of the photos to see a few notes in Flickr (and of course the larger version).
