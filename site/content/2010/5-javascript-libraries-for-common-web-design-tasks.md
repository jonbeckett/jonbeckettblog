Superfish

Want smoothly animated menus with roll-over styling, submenus, and clean markup? Look no further than Superfish.

FancyBox

You've more than likely seen the Apple website, and their seamless modal video and image gallery windows - FancyBox provides the same functionality easily and quickly.
