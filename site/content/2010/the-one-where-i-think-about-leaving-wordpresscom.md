I've been in an email exchange with the support staff at WordPress all evening about changing my username. I want my username at wordpress.com to match my blog name. You would think this would be straightforward.

You would be wrong.

I can't quite believe it can be so hard to execute one SQL update statement. I know it's one statement because I'm a web developer, and I know the back end of WordPress inside out.

Granted, the version of wordpress running at Automattic is probably very different than the standard multi-user version, but still - how hard can it be to change a username?

Even more stupidly, because I own the blog with the name I want, I cannot register it as a new username - because a blog exists in the system with the name already. Even if I delete the blog, it won't make any difference - the blog will be marked as deleted, but not actually gone - therefore the name will still not be available.

Aaarrrggggghhhhh.
