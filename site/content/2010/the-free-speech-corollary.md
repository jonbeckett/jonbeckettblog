I find it interesting that when a movie such as "The God Who Wasn't There" (http://bit.ly/cmPMVC) draws attention from the masses, those opposing it are the first to cry "free speech" when validating their hate filled diatribes - and yet they also invariably try to silence those who hold a different view than their own.

Double standards? Of course.
