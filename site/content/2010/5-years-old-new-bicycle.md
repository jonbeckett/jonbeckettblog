A certain little girl wandered into our bedroom this morning, rubbing her eyes.

"Happy Birthday!"

She smiled, and shrugged her chin into the nape of her neck.

"Can go down stairs and open presents?"

And so it was, twenty minutes later that I found myself stood in the street in the cold morning sunshine, filming the newly crowned "Little Miss 5" on her new bike.
