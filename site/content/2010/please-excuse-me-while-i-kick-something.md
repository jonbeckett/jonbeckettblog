For some unknown reason (and remember this is a professional software developer and web designer talking) the web server this installation of wordpress is sat on will no longer let me upload files.

What. The. Hell.

To be honest, I don't have time to fiddle with it, and I'm not sure I can really be bothered to do so. Standby for the entire contents of this damn blog to move elsewhere... the RSS feed will remain the same, and the domain name will... the platform may well be ripped out from underneath itself though. I'm sick of this.
